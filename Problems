1. ERROR: for db  Cannot start service db: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint api_model_db_1 (25efffcc88cf49e2d5b1230759d96c9f1b4fef485d315203148e5f80e39b79ff): Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:5432: bind: address already in use

sudo ss -lptn 'sport = :5432'
sudo kill ["pid"]

2. Check pg_hba.conf

sudo vim /etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf
sudo service postgresql restart

3. There is an issue connecting to your database with your username/password, username: postgres.
 Tried:
 - modify pg_hba.conf:
  - add: host all postgres <hostname> md5
  - change peer to md5 from # "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
  - change to md5 from # Database administrative login by Unix domain socket

Solved:
- DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://postgres:password@db/api_model_development"
  - explanation: above, where password is written, it was written the username...
